JUCI Application Server
-----------------------

This is a small server that loads backend lua scripts and exposes them through
a websocket interface using json rpc. It also supports serving static content,
making it perfect for replacing a large webserver when all you need is rpc
access and when you want to do is only run an angular.js application that does
not require anything more from the web server than the ability to serve static
content.
